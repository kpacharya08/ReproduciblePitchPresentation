```

## About the Project

This is my Reproducible Pitch Presentation. In this presentation, I describe what I did in my shinyapp project.

The project calculates the prime numbers based on the user input.

## How it works

- User enters a number in the input section.
- All the prime numbers less than or equal to it are displayed as output

## Logic used

R function **Primes(n)** is used for calculating Prime numbers as shown by the snippet below.
```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
    library(numbers)
    #Output of Primes(20)
    Primes(20)
```

## The Application

Please have a look at the application at
